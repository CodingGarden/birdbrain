# BirdBrain 🐦🧠

Declarative and realtime data management for ultra responsive Feathers and Vue.

* idiomatic Vue composition functions – useGet / useFind / useMutation / useFeathers
* powerful caching with realtime updates and live queries

This library was very much inspired by the [figbird (Feathers + React) library](https://github.com/humaans/figbird)

## A note on the name
